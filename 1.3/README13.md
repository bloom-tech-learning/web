# WEB48 - 1.3 - JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTALS

One of the most powerful web languages is JavaScript. Without it, there is no web. All web browsers use JavaScript in some fashion to power rich user experiences for those interacting with a web page or application.

JavaScript is everywhere today! And we have the opportunity here to dive deep enough into the language to teach you how to be proficient in building modern, complex and beautiful web applications that are used to power the web today!

## Scope and Closure

This module will give you practice with function scope and closures. Closures are an important programming concept that often come up in job interviews. Closure can help solve complex problems with ease, and builds nicely off of what you've been learning the past few days.

## Advanced Array Methods

This module will give you practice with advanced array methods such as .map, .filter, and .reduce and introduce you to the idea of callbacks. Both advanced array methods and callbacks will make it easier to interact with large data sets, like we started in the last sprint. As you progress in your journey as a web developer, these will likely become some of your favorite tools for both displaying data, and dealing with user data.

## Prototypes and Inheritance

This lesson introduces us to the this keyword and it's many uses. After we learn about this we are prepared to discuss prototypes in JavaScript and explore how they are in every aspect of JavaScript.

## Classes

JavaScript IV introduces you to the powerful paradigm of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript. We will take a deep dive into these topics:

The JavaScript Prototype object
constructor functions
Pseudo-classical Inheritence
the class keyword

By the end of the day you should be familiar with objects and how to use Constructors and Classes to build out objects and achieve inheritance across these objects.
