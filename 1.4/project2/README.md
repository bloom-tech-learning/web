# Module 2 Project - Resumes, LinkedIn and online profiles

## Module Project

Apply your learnings with this three-part project. The below assignments are required, and should be completed within your module project block. You're encouraged to use slack channels, or talk to your peers, or mentors about any of the career projects!

For this project, make a copy of this worksheet (Links to an external site.). Then, follow the related prompts. You will use your copy of the worksheet URL to submit your completed assignment. Be sure you have set sharing permissions to "anyone on the internet with this link can comment."

## Project Section 1 - Resume and LinkedIn Checks

### Resume Check

Your resume is a living document that will constantly need updates throughout your career. In today’s lesson, you got started with or updated your resume draft. Use project time to ensure you’ve incorporated all the necessary information you need for a tech resume, by reviewing the checklist below.

Resume Checklist:

### LinkedIn Check

Your resume and LinkedIn should be formatted for easy scanning; bullets help with scannability.

**Go to your LinkedIn profile and add the power statements you’ve created thus far as bullets in your profile experiences or projects sections.**

To populate bullets in a LinkedIn text box:

- Hold down the Alt key and type 0149 on the numeric keypad (for Windows). Release the Alt key. The bullet will appear immediately.
- Press Alt+8 on an Apple keyboard

## Project Section 2 - Power Statements

Any experience you put on your resume should have at least 2 bulleted power statement. Many of us rarely think of the work we’ve done in terms of data. Look through your resume and identify what data you could incorporate into power statements you've written.

How many customers or people did you work with in previous positions?

What volume of work or issues did you process?

How many projects did you assist with, and what was your average deadline, or completion rate?

Directly incorporate data insights into the current version of your resume draft.

## Project Section 3 - Online profiles

Get in the habit of making industry related posts on your LinkedIn or other profiles! Help people associate you with your profession and knowledge expertise by regularly posting about the skills you’re learning or using.

It may seem silly to create a post on Twitter or LinkedIn as simple as, “Learned how to use…[insert skill or technology here]”. Or maybe it's a blog post on Medium where you reflect on your first few weeks at Lambda School. As silly as it feels to write this type of content or posts, it goes a long way in helping others (especially employers) identify that skill with your abilities.

For today’s project, make a post or engage on a platform you can potentially commit to using more actively, for the purpose of building your online presence. In addition, find other users you might be able to connect with, follow, or comment on their work, so you can grow your presence. It’s okay to use LinkedIn for this exercise if that’s the only profile you want to use.

Paste a screenshot or evidence of a professional, public-facing post you made to a profile inside your copy of the project worksheet (Links to an external site.).
