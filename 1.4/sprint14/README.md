# Module 5: Career Development

## Sprint Challenge

This sprint focused on the fundamentals of career readiness. To recap, you learned:

-   What to expect in your field and potential career pathways available to you.
-   Expectations for the materials you will use in your job search, including your resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
-   How to build a strong professional network that will support both your career development and help you in your job search.
-   Strategies for responding to a broad range of interview questions.

 Apply your learnings with this four-part project. The below challenge is required, and should be completed within your 3-hour block. You're encouraged to use Slack channels, or talk to your peers or mentor about any of the career projects!

For your sprint challenge, you will build off of the foundations you set throughout the sprint to create a personalized career development plan that is tailored to your unique goals, experiences, and interests. This plan will consist of a set of goals that you can use to shape how you go about maintaining your career materials, building your network, and articulating your skills and experience, all of which you will continue to practice and grow in throughout the rest of Lambda School.

If you would prefer more structure or guidance in creating a career development plan, there are many excellent free templates online. We like these options from SHRM (Links to an external site.), International Association of Women (Links to an external site.), and UBC (Links to an external site.), but you can look around to find one that is right for you.

For this project, make a copy of this worksheet (Links to an external site.). Then, follow the related prompts. You will use your copy of the worksheet URL to submit your completed sprint challenge. Be sure you have set sharing permissions to "anyone on the internet with this link can comment."             

## Project Section 1 - Identify key steps and goals to help you pursue your career interests

At the start of this sprint, you got to know career opportunities in your field, ways you can build habits to take you closer to your career goals, and you practiced different goal-setting frameworks. You then learned strategies for polishing your resume and LinkedIn, building a strong network, and effective interviewing. Reflect on what you have learned throughout this sprint and unit 1 to create a professional development plan that will help you work towards your longer-term aspirations. You may wish to build on the goal(s) you set at the beginning of the sprint, or adjust these based on new knowledge.

Set three to five goals (can be short and/or long-term) that will help you work towards your broader career goals. Your goals should be based on your career level and past experience, and reflect what you learned this week, including the skills and habits expected of someone in your field. Use any goal-setting framework of your choice.

How do you plan to make progress on these goals and hold yourself accountable? Be specific about timing/scheduling this progress so you can stay on track.

## Project Section 2 - Get feedback on your resume and LinkedIn, and incorporate that feedback to strengthen the format and content of both

You have a few options for how you can get feedback on your resume and LinkedIn. We’ve broken down recommendations by career level, but you’re encouraged to pursue the option that is most relevant to you, or as a stretch goal, do multiple!

Emerging or junior professionals
Ask a peer in Lambda School or a trusted connection with resume and job searching experience for feedback. Or, if you already have a strong online presence on LinkedIn or another platform, consider posting a request to your network asking if anyone would be willing to share feedback.

Career advancers or changers
Reach out to a trusted colleague, mentor, or someone you know in your field and ask if they would be willing to review your resume and LinkedIn.

Remember to use any feedback that you do get from your network, even if it comes after this sprint ends!

## Project Section 3 - Identify people who can help you meet your goals

You set goals above, and you’ve already started to identify people to connect with in your network. Compare the networking plan that you worked on earlier in the sprint to your five goals; will that networking plan help you meet your goals? If not, edit your networking plan as needed so it is supporting your goals.

## Project Section 4 - Build your interview skills

You practiced interviewing and reflected on your interview yesterday, and will continue to practice interviewing weekly with your peer mentor. To further reinforce your skills, you have two options:

Option 1: Schedule an interview using Pramp (Links to an external site.), a free peer-to-peer interviewing platform.

OR

Option 2: Complete an informational interview with someone in your network; this can be the same person you reached out to in Module 2. Playing the role of the interviewer not only helps you learn about your field, but also helps you hear how other people talk about their experiences.

Regardless of the option you choose, you will need to submit a reflection in Unit 2. You should schedule your Pramp interview today or reach out to schedule your informational interview today. You can schedule it at a time that is convenient for you, but you will need to have completed the interview before Unit 2, Sprint 4. So plan ahead!
