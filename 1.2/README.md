# WEB - 1.2 - Advanced CSS and Intro JavaScript

## <span style="color:red">Overview</span>

You've already started using responsive units to write high-quality stylesheets. In this sprint we'll expand on that knowledge by covering responsive layouts, media queries, and accessibility such that you can build websites to work on mobile devices too!

This sprint will also introduce you to the wild world of JavaScript. We'll cover variables, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. These basic skills will be crucial as you go on to create dynamic and interactive web pages during your time at Lambda School.

Responsive design covers topics that range from fixed layouts to fully responsive websites. Responsive design addresses accessibility challenges and how developers can use flexible units to overcome them. On top of being accessible, fully responsive websites are a joy to use and push web development forward into the future.

JavaScript is the backbone of interactive web pages. This module will tackle basic syntax and logic in JavaScript including variables, math, conditionals, loops, and functions. These building blocks will inform the rest of your career as a web developer.

## [Module 3 - Arrays](https://github.com/beatlesm/web/tree/main/1.2/project123)

Arrays allow you, the developer, to work with lots of changing data efficiently to keep code DRY. Arrays, combined with the programmatic logic from the previous module, provide data to webpages, and make your life as a developer, a lot easier.


## [Module 4 - Objects](https://github.com/beatlesm/web/tree/main/1.2/project124)

[https://github.com/beatlesm/web-module-challenge-objects](https://github.com/beatlesm/web-module-challenge-objects)

Objects are yet another data type that can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). In this module you'll explore object syntax and some basic methods to work with object data.
