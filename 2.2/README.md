# WEB - 2.1 - Career Development 
*Please note some content will only appear on the day a module is taught. Each module project is due by the end of the day.*

## <span style="color:red">Overview</span>

Welcome to the beginning of your professional journey as a Web Developer or Data Scientist. Over the next few months we'll teach you more than just the technical skills needed to perform work in your field! Career and professional development is just as important as your technical development, so through career modules, we'll teach you how to: network, write a resume, create a LinkedIn profile, excel in interviews, and approach your job search, just to name a few topics. You can always access career resources under the career services (Links to an external site.) tab of your my.lambdaschool.com profile.

This week, we'll be kick off your professional development with the following modules:

# WEB - 2.2 - Intro to React

## <span style="color:red">Overview</span>

React is a UI library that is used in various forms to create complex, rich user interfaces. Facebook needed to build something that could power their user experiences in such a way that was decoupled and unconcerned when and where the data was received.

React is one of the most popular UI libraries today, and in terms of Single Page Applications, many (including the React team) tend to think of the library as the "V" in MVC. That is the View layer of the Model, View, Controller paradigm. React is a pattern, a mindset, that will help developers build small, reusable pieces of UI that can be easily put together to make a large-scale application.

## Module 1: React Components and Component State

Components are the building blocks of React applications. We use components to display some data (often called "state") to the screen for our users. This module will teach how to build components that can hold state to create an excellent experience for our end users.

## Module 2: Composing React Components and Passing Data Via Props

As you build more extensive applications, you'll want to start splitting up your app into smaller pieces so that it is easier to work on and maintain. These small pieces you will build are called components. Components will need to share state, so we will learn to do this with a helper object called props.

## Module 3: Component Side Effects

Side effects in web apps are very common. Therefore, it's essential to understand what side effects are to handle them properly in our components.

## Module 4: Advanced Styling Techniques

CSS by itself can be hard to scale in large applications. In this module, we will see multiple libraries that have been built to help us style our apps in a much more scalable way.
