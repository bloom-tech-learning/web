# React Components and Component State

## Running this project

### Objectives:

-   1.) What is React and what problems does it solve?
-   2.) A more formal introduction to components.
-   3.) State as it pertains to programs in general, then state in a React component.
-   4.) User interaction to update state.

This project is set up with [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/), an npm package
that compiles our frontend assets and comes with an integrated development server.

The dev server runs on port `1234` by default, but will use another if `1234` is
being used by another application.

- Clone the repo.
- Navigate into the project folder.
- Run `npm i` to download the project's dependencies listed in the `package.json`.
- Run `npm start` to compile the project and spin up a dev server on `http://localhost:1234`.
