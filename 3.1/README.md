This week is all about exposing you to applying your Javascript knowledge to the Document Object Model (DOM) and creating rich Javascript user interfaces.

### Class Components

Today we will learn all about classes in React. Then, we will use classes to build out our components. Class components have been a big part of the React ecosystem. They brought a lot of functionality that we usually didn't get with the React API when using function components. Now with hooks, that functionality is available in function components. However, many projects will still have class components in them, and we need to be prepared to work with classes when we see them.

### The React Lifecycle

Every component in React has what we call a lifecycle. The lifecycle is a part of how our components operate under the hood. Being able to demonstrate understanding of the 'React Component Lifecycle' by knowing how to use a few of the "Methods" provided by it will help you understand how and why React behaves the way it does at times.
