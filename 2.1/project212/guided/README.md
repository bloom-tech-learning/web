- Clone the project from Github
- Using your command line, navigate into the project folder
- Run `npm install`. This downloads all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file
- Run `npm start`. This compiles the project and launches a development server
- Navigate with Chrome to the URL indicated by the output of the `npm start` command

**Please, do NOT run the project using `live-server`, or VSCode extensions, or however you were doing it in the past, before attempting the previous steps!**

If we can't get get `npm install` and `npm start` working, we are still able to follow the guided project, but we won't be able to compile this afternoon's project. Use the help channel to get Node and NPM working correctly.
