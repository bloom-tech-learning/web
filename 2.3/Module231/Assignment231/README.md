# [Assignment 2.3.1 - React Router](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1675/assignments/51384?module_item_id=617512)

Due to the insane popularity of JavaScript frameworks and what we call Single Page Applications (SPAs), we rely on our modern web browsers today for a lot more than we used to in the past. One of the common trends with SPAs to see today is the idea of Client-Side Routing or the browser taking care of "URL" history

This module will guide you into the intricacies of React Router V5. As you learn and discover the inner workings of this package, your SPA's will start to come to life, you'll have more control over how your users view the content they're supposed to be viewing, and you'll be granted a rich developer experience. A lot of the items discussed here lend themselves to being commonly used.
