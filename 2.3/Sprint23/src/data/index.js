      "Ah, nostalgia. Give yourself a double dose with this grown-up, just-for-you version of one of childhood's greatest gadgets: the reel viewer. Assemble snapshots of your favorite memories and add them to your very own reel using the redemption code included with your viewer. Once you receive your made-to-order reel, pop it in the viewer and marvel at baby's first steps, or your favorite beach at sunset, or... well, whatever else you want immortalized. Remember: You're the view master now. Made in Oregon.",
