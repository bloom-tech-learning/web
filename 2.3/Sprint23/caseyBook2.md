Alright all @here, the OPTIONAL React-from-scratch code along is starting in ~10. It will be recorded and I’ll share the recording either sometime tonight or tomorrow morning.
### Topics to be covered:
-   1.) Initial wireframe of a project (break it down into components, which component holds which data, how to come up with MVP)
-   2.) State
-   3.) Props
-   4.) Axios
-   5.) Routing (Route, Link, possible useRouteMatch / use Params if time)
####    ALSO
-   1.) Git (what is it and why was it created?)
-   2.) Different git flows
-   3.) Reason for branching / forking
-   4.) Create a feature branch, complete the feature, merge into the stage branch, complete qa + testing, merge into the main (production) branch
####    ALSO
-   1.) Lots of duckduckgo’ing (depending on how much I forget)
-   2.) Lots of doc reading (depending on how much I remember)

### Node.JS 

```

    npx create-react-app my app

    npm install axios
