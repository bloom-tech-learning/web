# WEB - 2.3 - Single Page Applications

## <span style="color:red">Overview</span>

This week we'll be learning about using three crucial concepts in react - routing, forms, and testing. With the UI Library (React), the Client-Side Routing Library (React Router), the Form library Yup, and the testing app Cypress, you'll be able to craft rich, robust, and highly scale-able Single Page Applications.

The approach here exposes you to the concept of a 'single page application' that doesn't concern itself with the data it will present to the user. This is how modern applications are built today, where the client (React App) and server are separated into their concepts.

## Module 1: React Router

-   **[https://github.com/LambdaSchool/React-Router-Movies](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/React-Router-Movies)**
    Create an app that renders a list of movies in one route, and a movie info page in another route.

Due to the insane popularity of JavaScript frameworks and what we call single page applications (SPAs), we rely on our modern web browsers today for a lot more than we used to in the past. One of the common trends with SPAs today is the idea of Client-Side Routing or the browser taking care of "URL" history.

This module will guide you into the intricacies of React Router V5. As you learn and discover the inner workings of this package, your SPA's will start to come to life, you'll have more control over how your users view the content they're supposed to be viewing, and you'll be granted a rich developer experience. A lot of the items discussed here lend themselves to being commonly used.

## Module 2: Form Management

## Module 3: Advanced Form Management

## Module 4: cypress.io

-   **[https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Cypress-Testing](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Cypress-Testing)**

In this module, you will learn about testing. Writing good quality code isn't possible without tests. It's simply too difficult to catch every error on your own. In your careers, you'll be expected to write and understand different types of testing to speed up your workflow, prevent bugs, and integrate systems.

The visual testing application, cypress, is a great place to start learning about testing principles in general.
