    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one?
        The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML. IDs are only used 
        when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it. However, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.

        Use a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements throughout the page/site. Classes are useful when you have, or possibly will 
        have in the future, more than one element that shares the same style. An example may be a div of "comments" or a certain list style to use 
        for related links. Examples of class names are: tag, comment, toolbar-button, warning-message, or email.

        Use the ID when you have a single element on the page that will take the style. Remember that IDs must be unique. In your case this may be the 
        correct option, as there presumably will only be one "main" div on the page. 
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
        class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character,

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        inline elements appears on the same line. Well, block starts on a NEW line and takes up the full width available. So that means block elements 
        will occupy the entire width of its parent element.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        by flex
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default: <div> <Section> <form>
        Name 2 elements that are diplay inline by default: <a> <img>
        Name 1 elements that are diplay inline-block by default: < button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
        The box model places all html elements into boxes. The make-up of each box is the content (text or image), padding (blank space around the content), 
        border, and margin (blank space around the border). We use CSS to add style in our box model. By default, most html elements are boxes - however, there are 
        some, including <span>, <a>, <button>, and others, that don't follow these rules. These can be modified to follow the box model in CSS with display: block.
